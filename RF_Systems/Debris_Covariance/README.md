Before Running script, ensure that the Functions folder and sub folder is added to file path in MATLAB. 

Run Main_IOD_V3 for the side-looking geometry to define Number of Observations required for positional uncertanity convergence. 

Then run MC_simulation.m, with the 3 sigma uncertanity saved in the script, to propagate the Error Ellipsoid forward in time 

Produced Graph defines the revisit time required
